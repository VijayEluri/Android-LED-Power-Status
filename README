Android LED Power Status

This simple app starts up a notification service whenever your device is plugged
into a power source.  While charging, and while your phone is asleep, the app
will notify you of the current charge state with an array of colors ranging from
red, to yellow, to green.  Each color represents a battery charge range,
which is more descriptive than the existing charged/not-charged LED indicator
that Android devices provide by default.
